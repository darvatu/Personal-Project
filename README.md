# Northcoders News API

For instructions, please head over to [L2C NC News](https://l2c.northcoders.com/courses/be/nc-news).

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (nc_news_test and nc_news). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
